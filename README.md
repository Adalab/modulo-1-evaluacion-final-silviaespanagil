# Javascript: Final evaluation for Adalab
## _Website Layout_
¡Hola!

After a whole month of HTML and CSS code, this is my final presentation of a website home page layout ✨

## Requirements 📋

- A responsive homepage website
- Must include flexbox and grid
- The menu button must be fixed
- All footer's links must got to Adalab's website
- Hero button must be linked with "3 reasons to purchase" section
- Footer button must scroll to the hero
- "Go" and "3 reasons to purchase" buttons must have a hover transition.
- Footer's button could have an animation 🎯 
- Designer styleguides must be followed

## Tech 💻
Starring:
[Adalab Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit)  - An amazing template that allowed me to use a local host, SASS, HTML Template Engines and gulp. For more information you may visit [the Kit repository](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit)

### Built with 🔨
- Visual Code Studio: as code editor
- HTML
- SASS
- GULP

## Development ⌨️

For this project development I followed the designer guidelines and did an old and classic paper draw.

This way I was able to dissectionate each part of the design to partials so I could take advantage of the HTML template engine that the Starter Kit provides me.

I started the development with an Mobile First approach and after it I wrote the required mediaqueries to adapt the design to other devices.

Finally I used SASS for the styles. As in with my HTML, SASS allowed me to approach the styles one part at a time so I could follow the guidelines neatly.

This is how my partials look like

## Want to clone my repository? 🐑🐑

Remember that this repository was done using the [Adalab Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit) so I highly recommend to visit the link provided before running the proyect. 

<sub>[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and Gulp are required <sub/>

After you clone the repository you must:

1) Install dependencies.  You will only have to do this once.
```sh
npm install
```
2) Start the proyect. This must be done everytime you code and will open a local host that will  update in real time
```sh
npm start
```
3)  If as me, you happen to use GitHub Pages you may send your code to production using 
```sh
npm run push-docs
```
<sub>PD: You will have to set your GitHub Page as master branch /docs folder.
For Gulp installing you may run
 
 ```sh
npm -g install gulp-cli
```
<sub/>
